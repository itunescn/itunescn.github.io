  description: 'Hello Vino is your personal wine assistant. The only wine
    app that gives you wine recommendations for meals, occasions, holidays,
    and also based on your taste preferences. NO SNOBS ALLOWED!


    "Hello Vino can help almost anyone navigate a wine list." - NY Times


    "This app is incredible. Even the newest wine drinkers should feel at
    ease..." - Mashable


    "If you want to impress your date, pull up Hello Vino to make it look
    like you know whether to order a Zinfandel or a Malbec." - NPR Morning
    Edition


    IF YOU LOVE WINE, but you don''t know much about all the obscure grape
    varieties, regions, vintages or other wine geek-speak, this app is for
    you.


    RECOMMENDATIONS - This app will help you BEFORE you buy. It''s made for
    the 99% of wine shoppers who need some help in the store or restaurant.
    Simply tell the app what you''re eating, or provide some general taste
    preferences, and Hello Vino will recommend the perfect bottle for every
    occasion.


    NEW! - REAL-LIFE CONCIERGE - You can now speak to a LIVE PERSON to help
    with your wine buying. It’s like having your very own wine expert on call.
    We have a team of wine-educated assistants based in California wine country,
    ready to help you find the perfect bottle.


    WINE LABEL SCANNER - Ever purchased a wine based on the label design?  Now
    you actually have a good excuse! Snap a pic of the wine label and Hello
    Vino will tell your about the wine (tasting notes, ratings, food pairings,
    etc.) and you can even order more of that delicious vino through the app.


    REMEMBER EVERY WINE - You''ll never forget another wine with Hello Vino''s
    photographic memory. Simply snap a pic and take a quick note to remember
    all of your wine purchases. You can also rate and share your favorite
    bottles via Facebook, Twitter & email.


    WINE SEARCH ENGINE - Powered by wine-searcher.com, the industry''s largest
    and most reliable wine search engine, the database includes more than
    6 million wines.


    NEW! - WINE GUIDE - An incredible dictionary of wine varieties. And, by
    popular demand (we’ve literally received hundreds of requests), you can
    use the app ”in reverse“ by getting food pairings and recipes based on
    the wine you already have. For example, if you already have a nice bottle
    of Pinot Noir, the app will suggest types of foods that pair well (with
    recipes powered by Yummly!).


    INSIDER WINE DEALS - Our wine experts have hand-picked the best wine deals
    available online. We also have promo codes for 1-cent shipping and even
    wine gift cards & vouchers (while they last)!


    FOOD & WINE PAIRINGS - Whether it''s pepperoni pizza, filet mignon, or
    even mac & cheese, Hello Vino has the largest food and wine pairing database
    in all the App Store. Simply choose your dish, then the app will tell
    you the best wine for the meal.


    WINE GIFT IDEAS - Need to bring a killer bottle of wine to your next festivus?
    Hello Vino has you covered with wine recommendations for every occasion
    (date night, holidays, dinner with the boss, etc.).



    Questions or Issues? Please email: hello@hellovino.com


    This app includes features that use Location Background Mode. Continued
    use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery
    life.


    With thousands of wine recommendations, pairings, and gift choices, Hello
    Vino is the most comprehensive wine app available. The free app provides
    specific wine brand recommendations with tasting notes, ratings, and label
    photos, and lets you keep track of your shopping list or even purchase
    wines through the app.


    Keywords: wine, vino, hello, hellovino, food, food and wine, wine pairing,
    scanner, ratings, recommendations, dining, restaurant, dinner, shopping,
    store, search, bottle, cellar, bar, drinks, wine tasting, wine help


    Please send feedback and support issues to hello@hellovino.com for a quick
    response.'
