  description: "The Internet is forever. Your private communications don´t
    need to be.\n\nSend self-destructing messages for free to other Wickr
    users anywhere in the world while leaving no trace.\n\nSend and receive
    text, photos, videos, voice and pdfs that are:\n- CONTROLLED - sender
    owns the data and decides who sees what, where and for how long\n- PRIVATE
    - only the recipient sees your data, no strangers or servers in between\n-
    PROPERLY ENCRYPTED - we do not have the keys, each message has a new unique
    key (ECDH521,RSA4096, AES256, TLS)\n- BOUND - each message can only be
    read on the device it was sent to for added security beyond the math\n-
    ANONYMOUS - we require no personal info from you, we collect nothing about
    you or what you do\n- PROXIED - we proxy the IP between the sender and
    receiver\n- NO METADATA - we delete attachment metadata (location, time,
    identification and edits)\n- SHREDDED - Secure File Shredder forensically
    erases unwanted files you deleted from your device\n- COMPLIANT - FIPS140-2,
    HIPAA, exceeds NSA Suite B Compliance (Top Secret)\n- INTEGRATED - send
    pdfs and images from Dropbox and Google Drive\n- TESTED - tested by Veracode,
    Stroz Friedberg at DEF CON, and now NCC\n- TRUSTED - advisors include
    Brian Behlendorf, Whit Diffie, Cory Doctorow, Paul Kocher...\n- CREDIBLE
    - featured in BusinessWeek, CNET, Economist, Forbes, New York Times...\n-
    EASY - takes less than a minute to get started, easier than email\n- FREE
    - save money on texting\n- CROSS PLATFORM - message with Android and iDevices
    (iPhone 4-5S, iPod Touch 4-5, iPad 1-Air)\n\nWickr was founded in San
    Francisco, California by a team of security and privacy experts that believe
    private communications is a universal human right that is extremely important
    to a free society. Today, that right is almost nonexistent.\n\nWickr flips
    messaging on its head, giving control to the sender instead of the receiver
    (or servers in between). Wickr is becoming the most trusted communication
    system in the world by giving power to the people.\n\nWickr uses AES256
    to protect data and ECDH521 for the key exchange.  RSA4096 is also used
    as a backup and for legacy app versions.  Wickr also uses multiple rounds
    of SHA256 for hashing and Transport Layer Security (TLS). Encryption keys
    are used only once then destroyed by the sender’s phone.   Each message
    is encrypted with its own unique key and no two users can have the same
    AES256 or ECDH521 keys ever (Enhanced Perfect Forward Secrecy-PFS). \n\nOur
    servers do not have the decryption keys, only the intended recipient(s)
    on the intended devices can decrypt the messages.\n\nWe take our privacy
    policy seriously. Compare ours to every other messenger app. Privacy policies
    can tell you a lot about what an app is doing.\n\nWe have made this app
    with the best available technology, but strongly encourage you only to
    send private messages to people you trust.  \n\nTo get further detail
    about how the app works, please visit the App link on our website at www.mywickr.com.\n\nFeedback
    and reviews are much appreciated! info@mywickr.com"
