  trackName: The Bump Pregnancy | Week by Week Pregnancy Tracker
  description: 'The Bump has reimagined from the ground up what a pregnancy
    app can be, the ways it can help keep you happy and healthy, and how it
    can answer the two questions that every mama-to-be is asking, “Is this
    normal?" and "Is this safe?”


    We are thrilled to partner with Every Mother Counts for the Bump It Forward
    campaign during the month of October. For every download of the app, we
    will make a donation to this amazing non-profit organization that, both
    in the United States and throughout the world, brings education, resources
    and aid to women to ensure they have safe pregnancies and childbirths.


    The Bump Pregnancy app features:


    ● NEW! Clean design that focuses on keeping everything simple.

    ● NEW! Feed of authoritative articles, Q&As, community posts and tools
    timed to the exact week of your pregnancy.

    ● NEW! From the editors of The Bump, thousands of articles and Q&As that
    explain in everyday, supportive language what’s happening with your body
    and baby.

    ● Community forums that support over 15 MILLION moms and moms-to-be.

    ● Week-by-week checklist so you won’t forget a thing. And everything you
    check off on the app syncs with The Bump website.

    ● Take (and share) belly photos, and see them unfold in a slideshow of
    your own pregnancy.


    This is only the beginning. Over the next few months the hard-working
    team of The Bump will bring you a whole new set of features so you can
    manage your pregnancy, personalize the app experience, search across both
    content and community at the same time, and much, much more. It’s never
    been a better time to be pregnant!


    In the end, this is your app. Please submit your suggestions using our
    feedback tool from the “More” navigation, and tell us how we can make
    it better for you. We read (and frequently reply to) every suggestion,
    and each feature in this release is the direct result of someone just
    like you sharing her ideas for what would make the perfect pregnancy app.
    Make your voice heard!


    Finally, if you love The Bump Pregnancy app and want to help other pregnant
    mothers-to-be, please take a moment to write a review in the App Store.
    We thank you!'
