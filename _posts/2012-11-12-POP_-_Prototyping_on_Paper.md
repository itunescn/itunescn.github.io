  trackName: POP - Prototyping on Paper
  description: "Have an app idea? Draw it on paper and use POP to make it
    running on your phone!\n\nThe workflow is ridiculously simple:\n1. Design
    on Paper\n2. Take Pictures\n3. Link & Play\n\n- Complicated wireframing
    tools slow us down. Why not use the most efficient tools, pen & paper,
    to create prototypes? That's why we make POP. You simply take pictures
    of your wireframe, link these pictures, and it'll work on iPhone!\n\n-
    It's great for professional designers. You can import your mockup images
    made with Photoshop or Fireworks, link them in POP, and they'll look like
    the real thing.\n\n- It's also great for anyone with an app idea. When
    you take pictures of paper prototypes, POP will automatically brighten
    up your images to make them more legible on screen.\n\n- When you're done,
    share your prototypes with friends and colleagues to get feedback. \n\n-
    Download now and happy prototyping!\n\n\n# TESTIMONIAL\n\n\"Ingenious
    Pop App Lets You Design Apps On Paper\" - Cult of Mac\n\n\"This iPhone
    app is every designer’s missing puzzle piece for prototyping on paper\"
    - The Next Web\n\n\"Just snap some pics of your sketches, link them together
    with a few taps, and voila: instant interactive prototype. No coding required.\"
    - FastCo.Design\n\n\"I was about to explore something very similar. Glad
    to see someone made it happen.\" - Jason Fried, 37 Signals.\n\n\"When
    doing mockups, I still find the traditional method of pen & paper to be
    the most convenient and comfortable. POP has not only made that possible,
    but a joy.\" - Steve Chen, Youtube\n\n\"This is delightful - It's your
    back of the napkin app UI sketches come to life in the most simple way
    possible, and ready to share with collaborators with a tap.\" - Phill
    Ryu, Impending"
