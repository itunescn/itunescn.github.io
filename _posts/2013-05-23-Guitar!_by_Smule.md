  description: "Guitar! by Smule brings you the unique experience of musical collaboration
    between guitarist and singer. Our carefully crafted list of guitar songs have
    been paired with real vocals from our Sing! Karaoke app, giving you the true feeling
    of playing with a live singer. \n\nYou create the invaluable foundation for your
    singer as you strum the chords of the song. Add personal flourishes on individual
    strings, a bit of vibrato, or emphasis on particular notes. And for advanced players
    or those who just want to jam out and sing to your own tune, check out our freestyle
    mode!\n\nYou always sound good, but practice makes perfect and it pays to play!
    The more you play, the more you earn. Start off in easy mode, and keep playing
    to earn new difficulty levels and more challenging songs. As you continue your
    journey, try out new guitar sounds by unlocking our Electric and Rock guitars.\n\nThis
    first version has a limited songbook because we wanted to make sure every song
    was fun, satisfying, and a bit challenging. We’re working on adding many more
    songs and singers, and we would love your feedback. Please suggest new songs from
    inside the app!\n\nThe current songbook includes: \n** When I Was Your Man - Bruno
    Mars\n** I Won’t Give Up - Jason Mraz\n** Bubbly - Colbie Caillat\n** Stand By
    Me - Ben E. King\n** I’m Yours - Jason Mraz\n** Your Song - Elton John\n** The
    A Team - Ed Sheeran\n** Home - Phillip Phillips\n** Hallelujah - Leonard Cohen\n**
    Amazing Grace\n** ...more songs coming soon! Suggest songs in the app!\n\nEvery
    song includes vocals provided by the talented singers from our Sing! Karaoke app.
    (Thank you!)\n\nPLAYING TIPS:\n* Strum - swipe your finger across the strings\n*
    Pick - tap a single string\n* Change the chord - select from the colored tabs
    on the left\n* Create vibrato - shake the phone\n* Emphasize a strum - swipe faster
    and you’ll play louder\n\nQuestions? Write support@smule.com, find us on YouTube
