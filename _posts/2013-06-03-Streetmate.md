  description: "Streetmate is street photography camera for story makers and photo-enthusiasts.
    What you shoot is what you get as a final image — exactly like on classic rangefinder
    film camera. \n\nStreetmate is for ones who love shooting photos and making stories
    using camera rather than snapping random objects and then constantly tweaking
    it until the subject inside gets unrecognizable. Streetmate brings back photographic
    experience to people who enjoy making photos most of all. \n\nIt’s social! After
    you shoot a story containing bunch of photographs, you probably want to share
    it, because stories are meant to be shared. Guess what? We’ve created a social
    network full of people just like you with their own stories and everything is
    built-in to Streetmate, so even if you don’t shoot anything that day, there is
    a reason to peak in and discover many interesting stories from people you follow.\n\nStreetmate
    photo-styles are hand-crafted and made with precision by learning and analyzing
    many classic and famous photographs. All of them are not destructive and enhance
    your photos as much as possible. Your photos will never look mashed, blurred and
    crowded with artificial effects!\n\n• Prepare\nBefore you start shooting you have
    to choose how your images will look. All photos will be in the style you choose
    from the \"drawer\", and you won't be able apply different styles after the photos
    have been taken. Think about it like using a roll of film in a camera. One roll
    equals one style.\n\n• Shoot\nStart shooting! Take up to 96 photos per story,
    whenever you like. You can pause and resume stories as many times as you wish.
    When finished, tap the Review button to develop your photos and view your entire
    story in photographs.\n\n• Review\nYour entire story is here, developed and ready
    to be shared. Delete the ones you don't like by tapping on them. Also, don't forget
    to add notes and hashtags to your story! Adding #hashtags will make your images
    and stories more discoverable.\n\n• Spread\nStories are to be shared! When you
    share your stories, everyone who follows you will get an update in their timeline!\n\n•
    Explore\nEveryone who uses Streetmate makes stories! Discover your friends' stories
    and follow interesting people to learn about photography and the world around
    you.\n\nStreetmate is compatible with all iOS devices currently in production.\n\nStart
    spreading your stories!"
