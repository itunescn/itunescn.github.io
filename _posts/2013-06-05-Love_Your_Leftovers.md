  description: 'This is a cooking app that will help you minimise waste and
    maximise taste!


    At some time or another (probably more often than we would like to admit!)
    we have all thrown out a piece of fruit, bread, vegetables, or leftover
    dinner. Not only is our wasteful behaviour hurting our wallets, it is
    also costing the earth.


    Well this app exists to put an end to that! Download it in time for dinner
    tonight and give your leftovers some much deserved love.


    Not only will we help you find the perfect recipe for those leftover ingredients,
    we will also show you how to plan your menu to avoid waste, and how best
    to store fresh food and leftover ingredients to keep them fresh for longer!


    When Holroyd City Council’s Love Your Leftovers community cookbook hit
    the shelves in 2011, we were blown away by how many locals not only wanted
    to read other people’s recipes but also wanted to have their own recipes
    published. So when we found out that the NSW Environment Protection Authority
    (EPA)’s Love Food Hate Waste grants were available again, offering funding
    for important community initiatives, we just knew we had to take the Love
    Your Leftovers message further! The result was the creation of this app,
    which allows a larger global community to share their best waste reduction
    recipes with others who are also passionate about cooking and minimising
    food waste.


    We are excited to think that with each new recipe that is submitted to
    this app, more people will be expanding their knowledge of how to cook
    delicious meals using leftovers and together, reducing food waste around
    the world. We hope that you enjoy this app and that it inspires you to
    Love Your Leftovers'
