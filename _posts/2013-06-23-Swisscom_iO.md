  description: 'iO is a cross-platform app for messaging and voice calls.
    The application utilizes push notifications to instantly get messages
    and calls from friends, colleagues and family. Start communicating with
    other iO users at no cost at all. All features are included without the
    need for extra in-app purchases.


    Why iO:

    * Free – chat and make as many phone calls as you want without any cost.
    iO uses your existing Internet connection (3G / LTE / WLAN).

    * No Log in – once you download and register iO you are always logged
    in and with push notifications you are always connected.

    * Personal – add a profile photo that will be shown to all your contacts.

    * Multimedia – send and receive pictures to and from all your contacts.

    * Contacts – there is no need to add contacts, your existing entries are
    automatically displayed within iO.

    * Offline – even if you miss push notifications or a phone call, iO will
    save your messages offline until you retrieve them during the next app
    use.


    Note:

    * iO works on your iPhone with virtually all carriers and networks but
    some carrier limitations may apply.

    * iO is an app for your iPhone, iPod and iPad are not supported devices.'
