  trackName: Making of Making Powered by NIKE MSI
  description: 'MAKING is a tool to inspire designers and creators to make
    better choices in the materials they use. We know that every decision
    a designer makes in the product creation process has

    an impact on the environment. But given the range of options that exist,
    making informed choices can be a challenge. That is why MAKING matters.

    Powered by the Nike Materials Sustainability Index, MAKING provides the
    information to enable users to make real-time, predictive decisions. Whether
    you are a designer, a product

    creator, or just interested in the impacts of the materials you use, MAKING
    will help you make better choices.

    How it Works

    Nike has been investing in ways to design more sustainable products for
    years. In order to best support Nike designers, the company spent seven
    years creating the Nike Materials

    Sustainability Index (MSI). Nike MSI was created using the best publicly
    disclosed information related to the environmental impacts of materials.

    Now Nike is putting this information in the hands of makers in order to
    inspire better choices that support more sustainable design.

    MAKING includes data from Nike MSI on widely used materials and allows
    users to rank them based on four key impact areas: Chemistry, Energy/Greenhouse
    Gas, Water/Land, and

    Physical Waste. The materials in MAKING are widely used in apparel, footwear
    and home goods.

    Each impact is weighted based on specific indicators, and each material
    included in MAKING is assigned a base material score. Materials are rated
    out of a possible 50 points with higher

    scores indicating a more positive environmental impact. More information
    on Nike MSI and the scoring mechanism used can be found by visiting www.nikemakers.com.

    MAKING is an easy-to-use reference guide to compare the impacts of materials.
    There are many other opportunities to design better products, and we know
    that MAKING is just the

    beginning of your journey. The choice is in your hands.'
