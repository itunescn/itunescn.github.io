  description: "Track your outdoor activities with Smore Paths – Strathmore’s
    outdoor recreation app. Enjoy healthy living and recreation with the app
    designed for our community.\n \nThe Town of Strathmore currently has over
    20 kilometres of multi-use pathway that provide opportunity for healthy
    outdoor recreation, along with an environmentally friendly transportation
    network. However, many of these pathways are unknown to community members,
    and many have questions about where to go next once they have reached
    the end of a path. Download this iPhone application, Smore Paths, which
    will make your outdoor activities more fun and interactive.\n \nThe map
    is composed of all existing paths in Strathmore as well as those linking
    the town with Eagle Lake. Locations of the paths, their surface type –
    being pavement or gravel – as well as approximate travel distance are
    included on the map. Users can track their times on the routes, and can
    see personal progress as they use the app.\n \nPremade routes are automatically
    downloaded to inspire immediate outdoor activity, and users can save their
    own paths as they use Smore Paths.\n \nFEATURES\n \n- Track your runs,
    walks, and bike rides on Strathmore pathways. Choose from predefined paths
    or create your own!\n \n- Monitor your pace and distance travelled through
    the app; set goals and watch as your fitness level grows!\n \n- Share
    your results with friends and family through Facebook and Twitter\n\nNote:
    Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease
    battery life."
