  description: "Free of charge to celebrate the App Store's 5th birthday!!!\n---------------\nBeat
    On - A Professional and Advanced Metronome，which has unique circle  design
    and advanced functions. \nWatch the Introduction Video: http://youtu.be/RLrWpddcJzk\n\nBeat
    On is based on the industrial standard MIDI technology. It is the most
    \ accurate metronome, and the Tempo of which can be corrected to two decimal
    places.\n\nBeat On offers two unique training modes, with this function,
    it builds your rhythm faster and smarter:  Accuracy Training and Speed
    Training. \n\nThe Accuracy Training Mode is to practice with a regular
    loop between Sound  On and Sound Off. You can follow the beat in right
    tempo even when the  Sound is Off, and you also can check if you are still
    on the right tempo  when the sound is back on.\n\nThe Speed Training Mode
    has easier ways to build your speed of strumming,  drumming or jamming
    other instruments. In this mode, Beat On automatically  changes the Tempo
    in optional speed rate(BPM) and bars. With this fundtion,  you can also
    set the starting BPM and finishing BPM to practice from fast  to slow
    or slow to fast, of course, you can make it loop.\n\nYou can easily customize
    the time signatures (1~6/2, 1~6/4, 1~6/8) and subdivisions, every beat
    can be divided in half note, quarter note, eighth note and the relevant
    triple notes. The accents of beats can also be customized to any position
    in one bar which includes Accent \"f\"  (Yellow), Unaccented \"p\" (Grey)
    and Rest \"Mute\" (Black).\n\nBesides hearing the beat tones and watching
    the beat sector on the screen, you can also See and Feel the beats in
    Flashlight and Vibration(iPhone Only). \n\nIf you are in a live show,
    it might be too noisy to tell your bandmate the right tempo. If you are
    playing in an orchestral band, it might be too far away to sync the beat.
    Now, tell your bandmates to Watch the Beat.\n\nIf you are a drummer, you
    may find it is difficult to hear the metronome when you practice. Now,
    Beat On solves the problem, it can transmit the beat by tactile sense
    : Vibration. \n\nYou can save tempo, time signature, subdivision into
    the setlist for practice, band jamming and live performing. You can reload
    and play, change the sort order and delete it whenever you want. Setlist
    window is small in default, if you have too many favorite lists to manage,
    you can change it into full screen.\n\nThere are many other cool features
    such as background-play, tone position reversal, audio output balance,
    independent APP volume control and more. With all those powerful functions
    and elegant designs, Beat On is going to be a great and the best metronome
    for everyone that loves music.\n\n\LBeat On v1.0 Features:\n*Based on
