  description: "The Best Way to Collect, Share, and Relive Your Memories.
    \n\nMemoir transforms your photos, the places you go, and your social
    media into memories that can be relived when they’re most interesting
    to you\n\n\nAUTOMATICALLY COLLECT MEMORIES WITH FRIENDS: \n\n... Did you
    know Emma took photos of you 2 years ago today? \n... Anthony has photos
    from dinner earlier, want them?\n\nMemoir automatically finds photos from
    when you and your friends were together - in the present and from the
    past. As soon as you request them, the photos your friends choose to share
    with you become part of your Memoir seamlessly\n\n\nRELIVE MEMORIES AT
    JUST THE RIGHT MOMENTS: \n\n... Whether it’s what you were doing exactly
    2 years ago this second\n... Because you’re hanging out with an old friend\n...
    Because you were visiting a favorite spot you haven’t been to in a while\n\n\nSEARCH
    YOUR MEMORIES AND PHOTOS: \n\n... When did I visit that restaurant in
    the West Village with Laura? \n... Let me pull up the photos from my birthday
    party\n\nFind memories and photos by people, places, dates, context, and
    more ­ no tagging or organization required. Memoir magically fills in
    the blanks.\n\n\nOWN YOUR MEMORIES: \n\nAdd, edit, curate, or delete your
    memories in Memoir. They’re your memories, do what you want with them.\n\n\nALL
    YOUR MEMORIES IN ONE PRIVATE PLACE: \n\nFor your eyes only. Only YOU can
    see and share the memories and photos in your Memoir.\n\n\nBACKED UP TO
    THE MEMOIR CLOUD - FOR FREE: \n\nAll of your memories are stored and backed
    up to the cloud. Never worry about losing a photo or memory again.\n\nCreate
    your Memoir today, and we’ll help you discover the important memories
    that are relevant to you, right now."
