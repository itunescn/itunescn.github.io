  description: "FREE FOR ONLY 24 HOURS! - \"Perfect Shot\" uses new technologies
    in iOS 7 to detect each individual set of eyes and smiles in a group photo
    to take one single perfect shot! \n\nNo more taking a great photo, only
    to realize that someone was blinking! All you have to do is hold your
    iPhone up and \"Perfect Shot\" will count how many people are in the photo.
    From here, it will constantly monitor everybody's smile and set of eyes.
    Once everybody is smiling (and not blinking), the app will take one single
    perfect shot without the press of a button!\n\n***TapMedia is donating
    25% of all profits from this app to DevFund! That means by downloading
    this app, you're helping somebody in need. Learn more at www.devfund.com\n\n--
    Getting Started Instructions --\n1. Simply hold your iPhone up to a group
    of people (or yourself), and the app will do the work!\n2. Optionally,
    we've included a manual shutter button if you wish to bypass the face
    and eye detection\n\n- Support for iPhone 5S is on its way!"
