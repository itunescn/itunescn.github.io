  description: "Pushpin is the best way to discover great places. \n\nWith
    31 million places worldwide -- from restaurants to bars to coffee to shops
    to the great outdoors -- you'll never run out of new places. With a quick
    double tap, you can like places instantly -- or, press and hold to pin
    a place and save it for later. From favorites to firsts, you’ll always
    find a great place to go with Pushpin.\n\n• Mobile first design:\nPushpin
    is made from the ground up for mobile. Everything in Pushpin is one tap
    or swipe away. Scroll down for venues, scroll up for the map, tap on categories,
    or double tap on a venue to like it.\n\n• Waterfall of great places:\nInstantly
    see all of the most popular places nearby in cards that include rich images,
    distance, a short summary of the place, and 7 shades of color to help
    you easily recognize the highest rated places. Since Pushpin uses Foursquare's
    3.1+ million locations, you can explore to your heart’s content.\n\n•
    Filter fast:\n6 key categories, 10 of the most important filters, and
    search. Want to see all of the cheap bars nearby? No problem! Filters
    and sorting options are one tap away and we've added popular categories
    at the top of the waterfall so you'll never have to type \"restaurants\"
    again. \n\n• Your favorite places:\nSee a great place you want to go later
    or come across your favorite restaurant? No need to leave the waterfall.
    Double tap on any card to like the place and press and hold on any card
    to save it for later.\n\n• Meaningful map:\nGo wild with a map of great
    places. Pushpin shows only the best places on your screen. This means
    you can zoom out and see the best places in San Francisco, or zoom in
    and find the best places in the three blocks around you. Forget about
    redoing a search in this area, we take care of it for you.\n\n• Delicious
    details:\nPhotos are just a swipe away. Top tips are front and center.
    Phone numbers are totally tappable. Maps are fully functional.  Oh, and
    we’ve got gorgeous mobile menus too. Like what you see? Tap into an OpenTable
    reservation and see instantly if tables are available. Or, customize your
    reservation in our mobile-friendly view."
