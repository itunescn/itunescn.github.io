  description: "Seene lets you share life in 3D with friends, family and followers.\n\nThe
    world isn't flat, and with Seene, neither are your photos. Seene creates
    a new kind of shareable 3D photo that brings together image, depth and
    movement in a way that is both familiar and new. \n\nYou can share within
    your Seene feed, or to other social networks. The results are fun and
    lifelike!\n\n• Take unlimited 3D photo seenes\n• Share instantly on Seene,
    Twitter, and Facebook\n• View seenes on your phone or the web\n• Find,
    follow, and interact with other Seene users\n• You can embed a seene into
    Tumblr\n• It’s more fun than taking a regular photo!\n\nTaking a seene
    on your phone is simple. Point your phone at your subject and move around
    it to capture from different angles. Your progress is overlaid on top
    of the video feed, and your seene will build automatically upon completion.
    See around your subject by rotating your phone in your hand. \n\nThe technology
    behind Seene pushes mobile phones to their limit. We support iPhone 4S
    and higher for taking 3D photos, and iPhone 4 and desktop web browsers
    such as Chrome, Firefox and Safari that support WebGL for 3D viewing.\n\n+++
    iPhone 4 users: please note you cannot take seenes on iPhone 4, you can
    only view them.\n\nWe’d love to hear about how you’re using Seene, so
    please send any questions, comments or suggestions to hello@seene.co"
