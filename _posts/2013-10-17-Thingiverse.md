  description: "MakerBot's Thingiverse is a thriving design community for
    discovering, making, and sharing 3D printable things. As the world's largest
    3D printing community, we believe that everyone should be encouraged to
    create and remix 3D things, no matter their technical expertise or previous
    experience. In the spirit of maintaining an open platform, all designs
    are encouraged to be licensed under a Creative Commons license.\n\nThe
    Thingiverse app lets you browse Thingiverse from the comfort of your phone.
    See what we’ve featured, what’s new and noteworthy, what the community
    has made, and what’s popular. When looking at the things themselves, scroll
    through beautiful slideshows of photos. Like items, add them to your collections,
    and quickly share them to your social networks or email. \n\n\nSince photos
    are so easily uploaded to Thingiverse from the app, it’s super simple
    to share images of your prints with the community. Update your profile
    and cover images from your phone, too.\n\nMake. Share. Discover."
