  releaseNotes: '• Now *everyone* with a fan account can login, even people
    with semicolons in their password!


    • If you purchase an album and tap the button that says "I have the app,
    listen now," then gosh darnit the app should not just open that album,
    that album should also *play*. It does now. The energy saved in aggregate
    is staggering.


    • How many times has this happened to you: you''re listening to the oldest
    Bandcamp Weekly available in the app, when suddenly a new show is published,
    and wham! the app crashes. Infuriating, right? No more, no more...'
