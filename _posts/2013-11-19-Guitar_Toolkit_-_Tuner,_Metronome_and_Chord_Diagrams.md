  trackName: Guitar Toolkit - Tuner, Metronome and Chord Diagrams
  description: 'EUM Guitar Toolkit is a collection of essential tools for
    aspiring guitar players. It consists of three tools you will use daily:


    1. An extremely accurate tuner

    2. A precision metronome, along with strumming patterns

    3. Interactive chord tabs with audio examples


    With EUM Guitar Toolkit, your favorite guitar tool is in your pocked,
    no matter where you are.



    **Extremely Accurate Tuner

    Guitar Toolkit features a chromatic tuner which helps you get your guitar
    in tune in mere seconds.

    Colored tuning bars quickly guide you to a great tuning.

    An extra meter makes you an expert who can go from great to perfect tuning.

    Audio samples of strings in tune allow you to tune by ear, great for developing
    your musical hearing.

    Most importantly, it is highly accurate (up to ±1/1000 of a semitone,
    i.e. ±0.1 cent precise).



    **Precision Metronome

    The metronome benefits from EUM''s RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology.
    It is extremely precise (±20μs).


    The metronome’s so-called „pendulum mode“ is just like your old traditional
    metronome.

    You can follow the beat easily, even in silent mode. With the help of
    the dial wheel, changing tempo is really simple.


    Changing time signatures is only two taps away. Set it to the time signature
    you need. Up to 8 built-in metronome tones guide your rhythm and the 13
    built-in strumming patterns will teach you how to play along easily.



    **Interactive Guitar Tabs


    The chord tabs contain 288 chords, more chords than you will probably
    ever need, including Major, Minor, 6, 7, Minor 7, Major 7, Major 9, sus
    4, etc.


    Not only can you see the tabs, you can also hear what they sound like.
    This is quite useful for beginners who learn chords but also for advanced
    users who are looking for inspiration. The chords can be sorted by both
    note and key signature.


    In key signature mode, you don''t need to switch notes to show the expected
    chords. All related chords will be displayed on one page.'
