  trackName: PM2.5 Monitor
  description: "PM2.5 Monitor is an app that allows you to monitor the air
    condition of the place that is recently well known for its fog and haze,
    which is China. Now, 114 cities in China is supported along with data
    of over 650 monitor stations nationwide. By searching the city you are
    curious about, you can very easily see the realtime air condition data.
    Up to 17 detailed monitoring data will be presented to you. What's more
    exciting is the app present the monitor station data in an elegant and
    simple way, with beautiful animation and intuitive indicator that can
    give you a feeling of what the current air condition is like.\n\nNote:
    Currently only support Chinese cities.\n\nAs this is the first version,
    app is quite simple. But I am planning to add more feature. So, what's
    next?\n-> let you quantify the air condition right around you (if data
    can be found)\n-> map view\n-> it's gonna be cool to know what does these
    number means\n-> maybe air quality data of other cities around world (maybe
    Mars one day?)\n\nIf you have any suggestions or bug report, instead of
    commenting in iTunes Store, a better way is to seen feedback to me by
    go to Settings, and then tap Send Feedback. Your feedback is very valuable
    to me. Let's make the app better together.\n\nWho designed this app? \nChris,
    a university student, a man based on numbers, natural born tinker and
    a tech savvy guy."
