  description: "Interviewy makes it easy to record the important stuff, keep
    it safe and quickly transcribe it later. TypeTag markers let you pinpoint
    the most important parts of your recording as they happen, so you can
    find them in a jiffy later on.\n\n- Mark the most important bits of your
    recordings with TypeTags\n- Skip straight to your TypeTags in playback\n-
    iCloud syncing; keep your recordings backed up automatically\n\nMake as
    many TypeTags as you like, and make them as long as you like. Either tap
    whenever you hear something interesting, or hold for the duration. How
    you use Interviewy is up to you, but since everything is synced with iCloud
    your recordings are safe if you lose or damage your phone.\n\nInterviewy
