  trackName: Spotd - Find your friends
  description: "Spotd [spot·ted] is a new and easy way to connect with friends
    while still maintaining privacy by using a permission based process to
    share locations. \n\nIt’s Friday night and you want to see where your
    friends are – send them a Spotd request! When they accept, their location
    will immediately appear on your map.\n\nWith Spotd you are invisible until
    you want to be seen... or as we like to say, \"Spotd when you want to
    be.\"\n\n-\n\nSpotd makes finding your friends simple, private and fun.\n\nWhy
    is Spotd different? A user’s location is only shared with their friends
    when they accept a Spotd request. Users can meet up with friends at the
    places they love to hang out at and stay invisible to everyone else!\n\n\nOther
    Spotd features:\n\n- Get directions to the friend you Spotd\n- Text or
    call right from the App\n- See friends in real time\n- Create an account
    or connect with Facebook\n- Block a friend so they can't Spot you (Don't
    worry, they'll never know) \n\nWhat's NEXT:\n\n1. Built in private chat
    system.\n2. iOS7 redesign updates.\n3. Splash page to help load data faster.\n4.
    And other great features!"
