  description: "Evaluate your business and set priorities for improvement
    with this innovation assessment tool. \n\nThe tool has been produced by
    String Theory in partnership with The Briefing. String Theory produces
    high quality resources and creative content for businesses and brands.
    \ The Briefing is an innovative New Zealand based members group supplying
    research and resources designed to support success in business.  \n\nThis
    is the prototype for the longer-term set up of a toolkit designed for
    assessing and improving business performance against a range of key areas.
    It is a companion to the 2014 Digital Disruption Research Report. This
    tool has been developed around the critical determinants of success in
    innovation identified in the research. It can assist you in determining
    how well prepared your business is going forward and enable easy prioritisation
    of areas of focus for improvements. \n\nThe assessment covers innovation
    capability (competence and ability) and innovation level (stage of development).
    \n\nIt is easy to use with a simple scoring system and a clear visual
    representation of the results. \n\nYou can repeat the assessment at intervals
    to see how you then progress against the goals you set.\n\nThe tool is
    designed for use by a business - and therefore to aggregate scores for
    multiple members of a leadership team, however, an individual can also
    use it. The first person to set up a group is automatically registered
    as the administrator and to invite other members. \n\nWe welcome your
    feedback."
