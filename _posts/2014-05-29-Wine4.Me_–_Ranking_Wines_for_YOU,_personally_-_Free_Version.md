  description: "Discovering great wine just got easier! We rank wines just
    for you based on your tastes.\n \nYou don’t have to be an expert to enjoy
    wine. Wine4.Me helps you explore wine with confidence by offering you
    personalized wine rankings based on your taste profile.\n\nHow is this
    done?\n1) Just tell us about a few of your favorite wines, i.e. grape
    types, wineries, regions and/or countries\n2) We use your input to create
    your unique taste profile\n3) Based on your profile, we’ll show you a
    ranked list of wines we know you’ll love!\n**We also let you rate the
    wine and the more ratings you submit the better we get at personalizing
    your wine rankings!\n\nEach wine in Wine4.Me’s extensive database is objectively
    analyzed one by one by wine evaluators (They can pinpoint wine characteristics
    with a 90% repeat rate … they’re kind of a big deal). This data is intricately
    indexed by patent-pending technology and passed through the company’s
    proprietary algorithm that compares the profile of each wine to your taste
    profile to offer personalized wine rankings. \n\nBasically, we use “magical”
    technology to ensure you buy a tasty bottle of wine every time!\n \nWine4.Me’s
    wine selections are widely available at many grocery stores and wine outlets
    such as Wegmans, Safeway, Albertsons, Kroger, H-E-B, Ralphs, Spec’s, ABC,
    BevMo and Total Wine as well as many popular restaurants across the United
    States.\n \n* Wine Discovery App\nWine4.Me is a mobile wine discovery
    app that combines wine experts, patent-pending technology and a proprietary
    algorithm to offer users wine suggestions based on their individual taste
    profile.\n\n* Personalized Wine Rankings\nEach wine in Wine4.Me’s extensive
    database is objectively analyzed one by one by wine evaluators and intricately
