    issue as well as to Democracy''s entire archive of past issues -- all

    they''re published in print. The app is optimized for your iPhone and
    iPod Touch, but will also work on your iPad and iPad Mini.


    About Democracy: A Journal of Ideas

    Democracy is a quarterly journal whose mission is to build a vibrant and
    vital progressivism for the twenty-first century, one that builds on the
    movement’s proud history, is true to its central values, and is relevant
    to present times. We don''t publish policy papers; we’ll leave the important
    details on budget line items and dollar figures to others. Rather, we
    seek breakthrough thinking on the concepts and approaches that respond
    to the central transformations of our time: the breakdown of the ladder
    of upward mobility; the promise and problems of an information-based,
    globalized economy; new national security threats which cross old boundaries
    and defy old assumptions from jihadist terrorism and nuclear proliferation
    to climate change, pandemics, and poverty; and a society where people
    work and live in new and different ways. We see our role as upsetting
    tired assumptions, moving past outdated and obsolete divisions, and stretching
    the envelope of what is accepted by and of progressives.'
