    Liberation Route Europe links regions of Europe that were liberated by
    the allied forces during the Second World War. The route starts in southern
    England and crosses into Normandy, France, on to Paris, the Belgian Ardennes;
    through into the Netherlands and cities like Eindhoven, Nijmegen and Arnhem;
    and across the German border into the Hürtgen Forest and on to Berlin.
    From there, it carries on to Gdańsk in Poland, where a democratic revolution
    led to the ultimate liberation of Central Europe in 1989, almost two generations
    later.'
