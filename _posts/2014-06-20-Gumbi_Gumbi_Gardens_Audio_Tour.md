  trackName: Gumbi Gumbi Gardens Audio Tour
  description: "The Gumbi Gumbi Gardens App offers a window into local Aboriginal
    and Torres Strait Islander experiences of history, culture, learning and
    everyday life.  \n\nElders share their stories and ideas giving a unique
    opportunity to enjoy a rich understanding of local Indigenous peoples
    in Toowoomba and the surrounding areas.  \n\nThe Gardens have been designed
    to provide a focus for reconciliation and healing between Aboriginal and
    Torres Strait Islander and other Australians; and the stories lead you
    on those paths of recognition and healing.  \n\nThis app can be taken
    as a virtual tour, but it is best enjoyed as you walk the paths and enjoy
    the Garden’s beauty and tranquillity.\nConnect, interconnect and reconnect…\nAdding
    to Toowoomba’s reputation as the Garden City, the Gumbi Gumbi Gardens
    Cultural site features extensive plantings of indigenous flora used by
    the local Aboriginal communities for a range of purposes, including food
    and medicine.\nThe Gumbi Gumbi Gardens covers approximately 2.2 hectares
    of land adjacent to the northern side of the USQ Toowoomba’s main entrance
    and include a number of small and large teaching spaces infused into the
    overall character of the development.\nMore than 100 plant species are
    featured in the Gumbi Gumbi Gardens, which have been designed in close
    partnership with respected Historical Elders from Toowoomba and Elders
    of the Jarowair People, Traditional Owners of the land on which the USQ
    Toowoomba campus resides.\nThe Gumbi Gumbi Gardens forms one part of the
    University’s commitment to developing a better understanding of local
    Indigenous heritage, and acknowledging the culture and contribution they
    have continued to make to their region."
