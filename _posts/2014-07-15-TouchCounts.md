  trackName: TouchCounts
  description: "TouchCounts lets children use their fingers, eyes and ears
    to learn to count, add and subtract. By tapping and swiping and by using
    specially-designed gestures for adding and subtracting, children create
    and manipulate their own numbers, developing a stronger number sense as
    they explore the mathematical foundations of ordinality, cardinality,
    and arithmetic.\n\nAs children begin to learn how to count with their
    fingers, TouchCounts is the perfect environment to solidify that learning
    and help them generalize beyond their fingers, “going past ten” into the
    endless world of larger values. TouchCounts allows children to focus on
    both ordered and operational views of numbers, inviting them to develop
    their number sense by creating and exploring coordinated number sequences
    tactilely, visually, symbolically and verbally. In addition, learners
    can explore how numeric quantities can be composed from–and decomposed
    into–other, smaller quantities.\n\nNeither a repetitive drill-and-practice
    worksheet nor an rigid \"level-driven\" game, TouchCounts is a mathematics
    exploration environment designed to allow students to discover, pose and
    examine their own questions and understandings. Sample activities on the
    TouchCounts website show parents and teachers how TouchCounts can support
    learners' conceptual understanding of number naming, counting, and skip-counting;
    ordinality, cardinality, even and odd numbers, less-than, greater-than
    and equal-to relationships; and subitization, addition and subtraction.
    \n\nBased on contemporary research understandings of how children learn
    mathematics, and developed by the Tangible Mathematics Learning Project
    in the Faculty of Education at Simon Fraser University, TouchCounts is
    intended for use in school, pre-school and at home; and with small groups,
    with 1:1 pairings of a learner and a parent or teacher, or individually."
