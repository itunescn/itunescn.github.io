  trackName: 'Pocket Reader: Have Your Pocket Articles Read To You'
  description: 'Pocket Reader turns any online article into an audiobook-like
    experience. Easily navigate forward and backwards as if it was an audiobook.


    This app was made to solve a problem I had. I used to sit in traffic for
    two hours each day, so to make use of my time I would read my Pocket articles
    while driving. Since reading and driving is a bit dangerous, I decided
    to build this app so that my phone could read to me instead.


    Enjoy, I hope you like it!


    Pocket Reader is fully integrated with the Pocket system. This means that
    all updates and changes you make from your Pocket App or this Pocket Reader
    App will be in sync.'
