  trackName: Pocket Desk for JIRA
  description: '** NOTE: Requires Atlassian JIRA with JIRA Service Desk and
    Pocket Desk Connector add-ons installed. See below. **


    Pocket Desk is a mobile companion for JIRA Service Desk. It helps service
    desk team members to keep track of their most urgent task and the time
    left to address it.


    Features:

    - Shows the current issue (the one at the top of the JIRA Service Desk
    queue).

    - Tracks and shows metrics for the current issue, such as “Time to respond”.

    - Shows the SLA status (grey - yellow - red) according to goals defined
    for SLA.

    - Notifies you when SLA status changes (so you may need to hurry).

    - Periodically synchronizes issue content when online.

    - When offline, continues to show issue information and metrics.


    Requirements:

    - JIRA 6.1 or later

    - JIRA Service Desk 1.2 or later

    - Pocket Desk Connector 1.0 or later (install from Atlassian Marketplace)


    Current Limitations:

    - Shows basic issue content only (summary, description, comments, attachments)
    - does not show fields.

    - Background notifications are shown for the current issue only (you need
    to switch to Pocket Desk to pull changes from the server).
