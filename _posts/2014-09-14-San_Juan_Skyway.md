  description: "An All-American Road, a National Scenic Byway, a Colorado
    Scenic and Historic Byway, and a National Forest Scenic Byway ... these
    are just a few of the names and accolades given to the San Juan Skyway:
    a 233 mile road trip through some of the most beautiful scenery in the
    country.\nThis app will guide you along your journey through the towns
    of Silverton, Ouray, Ridgway, Telluride, Dolores, Cortez, Mancos, and
    Durango. Each segment highlights stops along the way that shouldn't be
    missed. Beautiful photographs (many of which have direct links for purchase),
    insightful descriptions & information, and maps & directions are displayed
    for all 31 highlights.\n\nAn outdoor recreation section helps get you
    out of the car, truck or RV and shows you how to really enjoy and take
    in the natural beauty around you. Maps, descriptions, and photos are included
    for each recreation site. \n\nThere's an FAQ section to help explain some
    of the oddities you'll find along the San Juan Skyway and even a map of
    the (seasonal) restrooms for those breaks along the way!\n\nAn elevation
    profile and maps & directions to each chamber of commerce/visitor center
    in each town are just a couple of additional helpful resources at your
    fingertips.\n\nEnjoy the drive. It's an experience of a lifetime ... and
    this app will help make it an experience you'll never forget."
