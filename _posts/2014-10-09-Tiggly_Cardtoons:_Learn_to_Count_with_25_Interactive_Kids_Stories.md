  description: "Calling all future mathematicians and storytellers! (enhanced
    by Tiggly Counts)\nCount, drag, match, and enjoy as the seemingly simple
    buttons you create come alive becoming part of a wildly imaginative cornucopia
    of storytelling. Ordinary pieces of cardboard shuffle into a variety of
    positions, each time becoming something new and unexpected. One bluefish
    with a fancy bowtie, two peanuts for a hungry elephant, three candles
    for a cow’s birthday cake, four gumballs for a bubble blowing frog, and
    five silly bananas on a camel’s back! These are just some of the stories
    you will help bring to life as the buttons you create set the stage for
    a journey through counting and the depths of your imagination!\n\nTiggly
    Cardtoons will help you learn basic math ideas such as one-to-one matching,
    counting, and equal sets while stretching your imagination and sense of
    wonderment. These creative learning math stories are recommended for ages
    3 and up.\n\nFEATURES\n- 25 imaginative stories focused on numbers\n-
    Unique illustrations with textures taken from the real world\n- Guided
    counting gestures important for developing counting skills\n- Lots of
    free play surprises. Don’t forget to explore! \n- No third party advertising\n-
    No in-app purchases\n\nCOUNTING\n- Your child will create buttons by tapping
    and dragging them to targets, and listen to the narrator count as they
    interact with them\n- The buttons will transform into a variety of unexpected
    objects including 1 tiny flower, 2 giant peanuts, 3 brave little mice,
    4 leaves for a hungry herbivore to eat, or 5 yellow fish playing hide
    and seek with a submarine.\n- And, that’s only the beginning of the story!
    Tiggly Cardtoons will help your child concretize abstract math in the
    context of familiar yet surprising events. \n\nFLEXIBLE THINKING AND CREATIVITY\n-
    Ever wonder what you could make with two pieces of cardboard? How about
    if we add a third piece? A forth one? A fifth one? Creativity is about
    constant experimentation, surprises, and imagining things in many different
    ways. We invite your child to imagine what a piece of cardboard could
    transform into -- and in so doing, encourage them to imagine all the possibilities
    that abound in their everyday lives.\n\nABOUT TIGGLY COUNTS (sold separately)\n>>
    Kids love Tiggly Cardtoons as a standalone learning app, but better yet
    enhance your child’s learning with Tiggly Counts physical toys (sold separately).\n-
    Tiggly Counts are five colorful counting toys, safe for your tablet and
    your child, that physically interact with three parent- and educator-approved
    Tiggly learning apps for the iPad – including Tiggly Chef, Tiggly Addventure,
    and Tiggly Cardtoons.\n- Inspired by the classic Cuisenaire rods used
    in Montessori classrooms, Tiggly Counts is a revolutionary math learning
    toy for kids in the digital age\n- Tillywig Brain Child 2014 Award Winning
    Toy\n- Lightweight and easily grasped in small hands, Tiggly Counts toys
    help young learners understand the relationships between numbers both
    concretely and spatially.\n\nABOUT TIGGLY\nThe Tiggly team is made up
    of PhDs, MBAs, parents, grandparents, uncles, and aunts who want to help
    parents introduce their children to the digital world in an easy yet educational
    way. Our educator-designed tablet toys interact with our learning apps
    because we believe there is a powerful learning opportunity in the combination
    of physical and digital play. Children explore mathematic concepts and
    numerical relations by manipulating physical number blocks while playing
    in wonderful digital worlds that stretch their imagination, and spark
    their creativity. Our team collaborates with Grammy and Emmy-award winning
    creative talent to craft products that parents and children both love.
    Tiggly products are available in 20+ countries and in more than 300 Apple
    Store locations across four continents, in addition to specialty retailers
    worldwide."
