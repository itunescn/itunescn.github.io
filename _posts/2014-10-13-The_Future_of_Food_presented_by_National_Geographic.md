  trackName: The Future of Food presented by National Geographic
  description: 'Explore food with National Geographic in this special edition.
    Our exclusive report features in-depth coverage of the challenges of feeding
    our growing planet. Experience rich storytelling, stunning photography
    and video, interactive maps and graphics, and much more. Join our conversation
    on the #FutureofFood.


    Some of the questions we pose:


    Where will we find enough food for nine billion people?


    Can Africa’s fertile farmland feed the planet?


    Why are people malnourished in the richest country on Earth?


    Would eating as our ancestors did make us healthier?


    Could we save our planet simply by wasting less food?


    Is America’s appetite for meat bad for the planet?


    What is it about eating that brings us closer to family and friends?


    National Geographic is a global non-profit membership organization that
    believes in the power of science, exploration and storytelling to help
    people understand our world. Each year, National Geographic funds more
    than 300 research, conservation and exploration projects around the globe,
    and every month it reaches more than 600 million people through a wide
    range of media, including digital, print and TV.'
