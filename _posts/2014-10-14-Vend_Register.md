  releaseNotes: 'Thanks for using Vend Register. We''ve been absolutely blown
    away by the number of downloads and awesome feedback we''ve received from
    our amazing retailers! You guys rock!


    To make sure you continue to have the best point-of-sale for iPad, we''ll
    be releasing updates to Register every couple of weeks. Here are a few
    of the improvements we''ve made since launching it last week:


    – We''ve improved the way sales totals are shown for tax inclusive retailers,
    to make it clearer how much is being taxed.


    – We''ve squashed a bunch of bugs (including a quirk with the Quick Keys)
    so the app should run smooth like peanut butter.


    Remember, we''ll be making continual improvements to Vend Register in
    the coming weeks, so we highly recommend you enable automatic updates
    on your iPad. You can do this on the iPad by going to the Settings app,
    scrolling to ''iTunes & App Store'', and under the ''Automatic Downloads''
    section turning on ''Updates''.


    We love getting feedback and hearing from our retailers about anything
    (Seriously, do you have a cool new window display? Let us know!). Get
    in touch through email (support@vendhq.com), Facebook (facebook.com/vend.pos),
    or Twitter (@vendhq).'
