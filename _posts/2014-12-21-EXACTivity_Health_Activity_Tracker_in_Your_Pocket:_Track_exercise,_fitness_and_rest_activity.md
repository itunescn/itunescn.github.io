  trackName: 'EXACTivity Health Activity Tracker in Your Pocket: Track exercise,
    fitness and rest activity'
  description: 'Note: You will need an iPhone 5s or newer for EXACTtivity
    to work.


    Are you living as actively as you think you are? EXACTivity unlocks the
    true power of the iPhone''s M7 or M8 Motion Coprocessor. Why buy an activity
    tracker when you have an iPhone in your pocket? If you have an iPhone
    5s or newer, you already have an activity tracker.


    Track your daily activity by just carrying around your iPhone as you do
    every day. EXACTivity activity tracker logs and stores your daily routines.
    It totals up your daily activity whether walking, running, driving, sitting
    or sleeping.


    You will know how active you’ve been all day, and be able to hold yourself
    accountable -- now that''s motivation. Use it every day to set and meet
    your  goals and live a healthier, more active life. The best part? You
    don''t even have to think about it. Your iPhone does all the work while
    it sits in your pocket.


    Most apps only use your step data. EXACTivity shows you your daily activity
    whether you are on foot, on your office chair, driving to work, cycling
    or sleeping. The data comes direct from Apple''s Motion Coprocessor completely
    unaltered. We simply analyze the data and put it into a meaningful timeline
    that you can read at a glance. Know exactly how many hours you''ve put
    into each of your daily activities and what percentage of your day was
    spent doing each activity. You can know exactly what your M7 or M8 chip
    is recording.


    EXACTivity will also provide you with a backlog of your data that will
    allow you to look back at your activities. Because of the limitations
    of the iPhone''s M7 and M8 chips, the phone overwrites data that''s more
    than six days old. As long as you run EXACTivity at least once a week,
    your data will be saved so you can refer to it at any time for as long
    as you use the app. We have also made battery life a major priority. If
    you choose to run EXACTivity in the background (recommended) the drain
    is minimal.


    - Know how active you really are with EXACTivity tracker.

    - Simple, easy to use activity tracker for iOS.

    - Designed for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

    - Uses the iPhone’s M7 (iPhone 5S) or M8 (iPhone 6, 6 Plus) Motion Coprocessor
    to log daily activity.

    - Motivate yourself by tracking what you’ve done every day and for how
    long you’ve done it.

    - If you already have a fitness tracker, you can compare its data with
    your iPhone''s.

    - Learn what your M7 or M8 chip is actually recording.

    - View your data at a glance through your daily activity timeline.

    Because the M7 and M8 do not always record information 100 percent accurately,
    we are developing ways for users to edit their data in order to ensure
    the best results possible.


    Future Releases:

    - Edit activity data

    - Backup activity data


    Disclaimer: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically
    decrease battery life.'
