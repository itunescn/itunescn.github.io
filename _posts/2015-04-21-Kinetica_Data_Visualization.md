  description: 'Kinetica is an app for exploring data on your iPad. Instead
    of forcing you to use a boring old spreadsheet, Kinetica lets you see,
    touch, sift, and play with your data in a physical environment. Each row
    of data becomes a circle that responds to your touches and interactions.
    Want a chart? Pick two columns from your table and then magnetically graph
    them. Want to filter some data? Grab a sifter and drag it across your
    data, picking up the points you don''t want as you go.


    Kinetica started out as a research project studying how we can help people
    understand information using tablet computers. In developing and testing
    it, we''ve had users exploring models of cars trying to find the vehicle
    for them, understanding deep trends in data about the Titanic shipwreck,
    and exploring census data to learn about the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.


    Features:

    - Magnet charts that pull data to their proper places.

    - Interactive sifters that tangibly filter points.

    - Lenses that expose hidden trends in the data.

    - Tools for grouping, coloring, and sizing points.

    - Mix and match techniques to investigate more than 5 dimensions on one
    iPad screen.

    - Save and share discoveries with friends.

    - Load any Excel XLS, CSV, and TSV table of data'
