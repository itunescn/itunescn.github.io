  description: 'What is Swipe?

    Swipe offers a platform for voting on social issues, sharing opinion or
    views

    Swipe is not a place for: mocking religions, races, people’s sexual orientation,
    or disparaging other people’s viewpoint; rather it’s a place for having
    healthy discussion on social topics or things that matter to common people
    in India.

    We believe potential of people’s voice has not been utilized yet. Through
    Swipe we are building a centralized community interested in sharing solutions
    and work as one team to make their voice count. To participate in this
    community, it is essential that we all are conscious or aware of the problems
    within our society.



    What can I do on Swipe:

    Explore, find, and learn about new topics and trending issues

    Make your voice count by voting on the topics that interest you or matter
    to you

    Share your opinion to justify your vote

    Participate by following an interesting discussion and actively sharing
    your views on the topic

    Submit new topics or questions to collect other Swipe users’ views
