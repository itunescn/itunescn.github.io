  description: "Critically-acclaimed TimePrep engine now available for SAT®
    exam with free demo inside!\n\nTimePrep is an intelligent time management
    solution and learning strategy assistant for the SAT® exam students!\nSet
    it up in a matter of minutes and you're ready to go! \n\nDo you have difficulties
    organizing your study efficiently? Does it feel hard to grasp the amount
    of time necessary to get ready for your SAT exam? You feel like there's
    not enough time left? Don't worry, TimePrep is here – right on time!\n\nLack
    of an efficient time management system is the main obstacle in passing
    the SAT exam. The curriculum is not so demanding, but an average student
    must put a lot of work into it - go through all the topics (Math, Evidence
    Based Reading, Writing and Language, Essay) and all the types of problems
    in order to get ready for the exam. Therefore, a student usually gets
    lost in organizing the learning process. The help of a tailor-made time
    management system proved crucial in the preparation process. That's what
    TimePrep is all about. \nThe app takes into account all the necessary
    elements of the preparation materials the student may go through in order
    to pass the SAT exam. The student can personalize the application by indicating
    the number of pages she or he can read in an hour, the materials used,
    elements (end of chapter problems, practice problems) used, etc. After
    personalization, the application calculates how much additional time a
    student has to dedicate in a usual week in order to complete the chosen
    strategy in a timely manner. This is crucial for an average student, because
    it is really hard to perceive the weekly routine that will lead you to
    success in a period of couple of months.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Daily-weekly
    learning study plan\n- Personalized daily study schedule\n- Rescheduling
    system for failed events\n- Statistics module for tracking progress\n-
    Variety of materials available to configure your study plan from\n- Support
    for The Official SAT Study Guide for New SAT exam (Blue Book), the previous
    one and for more specific Gruber's, Barron's and Powerscore's\n- iCloud
    Calendar Sync\n- Reminds you of important dates\n- Free study tips and
    exam tips\n- State of the art design and simple setup\n\n „Awesome! Made
    my studying way easier and definitely more organized – I managed to get
    into the college I wanted!“ – DAS\n „Great, simple, efficient!“\n\n\nSAT®
