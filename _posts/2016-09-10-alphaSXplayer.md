  description: "The rich featured audio player\\recorder with adjustable playback
    speed and many built-in special effects. The alphaSXplayer is built on
    low-level iOS components to make use of even more sound effects and features.
    This incredible range of playback manipulations and sound effects means
    limitless possibilities and a lot of fun: \n\n- Variable playback rate:
    Change the audio playback speed without affecting sound quality. \n- Custom
    pitch: Change the music and voice timbre from high to low pitch (think
    squirrel or Darth Vader). \n- Toggle between standard A 440Hz pitch tuning
    or the more harmonious A 432Hz that lets you hear music (especial classical)
    as it was imagined by composer. Set the tuning to A 432Hz lets you experiment
    with the musical timbre considered most favorable for human souls and
    good health!\n- Ten bands equalizer with a variety of presets (classical,
    pop, rock, jazz, etc.).\n- Built-in sound effects: reverberation, distortion,
    time delay, echo and more, with plenty of presets and adjusted parameters.\n-
    Preamplifier increases sound volume beyond the original setting.\n- Build-in
    voice recorder uses the microphone on your device and stores audio as
    MP4 files in a subfolder for playback and adding special effects. \n-
    Realistic analogue meters indicate playback and voice recorder level.\n-
    Intuitive dialog interface makes it easy to choose files for editing,
    adjusting or playing. Selected files appear in an editable playback queue
    table. \n\nThe alphaSXplayer supports all features as recommended by Apple’s
    iOS Human Interface Guidelines for audio applications.\n\nEndless possibilities
    and fun for all ages\n\nWith its unique built-in features, alphaSXplayer
    is a convenient audio player or voice recorder for all sorts of learning
    and fun.\n\nPossible scenarios and ideas of usage:\n- Foreign language
    study: Play audio files in a slower playback setting to catch pronunciation
    details. Use the built-in recorder to load new phrases for playback and
    study. \n- Audiobooks: Listen at a different playback speed, and adjust
    the pitch or correct a voice timbre to match your personal listening preference.\n-
    Hours of fun for all ages! alphaSXplayer is a beautiful, easy to use app
    for all sorts of audio learning and entertainment. \n- FREE version and
    UPGRADE: Try out all the basic audio player features free, or upgrade
