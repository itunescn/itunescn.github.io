  description: "Yup, you found it! This is THE journaling app. You have it
    all, fast journaling, moods, habits, interests, daily/weekly ratings and
    reviews, all on your Life Calendar. In one word, PERSPECTIVE - providing
    greater Insights and Self-reflection since March! \n\nWe designed the
    journaling experience as a conversation between your \"future self\" and
    your \"past self\", text message style, only more honest. The main focus
    of the app is to help you:\n\n•  Practice mindfulness and increase self-awareness\n\n•
    \ Learn and gain perspective from past experiences\n\n•  Understand what
    things are most important to you\n\n•  Increase your mental health, enhance
    the feeling of well-being, and become happier\n\n•  Develop the ability
    to put things into context as they happen\n\nPerspective is completely
    free and 100% private.\n\n------------\nTestimonials  (from our awesome
    Beta users)\n------------\n\n\"I really do love this app so far. I have
    always struggled with the use of these types of apps, but I can totally
    see myself continuing to use this.\" -Hannah\n\n\"I really like the experience
    so far. I think it's an awesome idea and could really be helpful to a
    lot of people.\" -Kelsea O'Brien\n\n\"It's a great App. I'm loving it!!\"
    -Tania Martins\n\n\"I have always loved the notion of journaling, but
    I have found that keeping the habit and making it meaningful can be a
    challenge. Perspective has been a game-changer for me. Daily and weekly
    prompts help keep my goals for journaling on the front burner, while journaling
    prompts give me ideas on days when I am feeling less than inspired.\"
    -Jenine Ziemann Sansosti\n\n\"I love the way journaling feels almost as
    if I am sending someone a message, as if there is someone on the other
    end.\" -Helen\n\n\"I'm loving everything about this app. This fills the
    void in journaling that I've been craving - a journal of my thoughts without
    cramping my hand from writing it out.\" -Ria\n\n\"This app is incredible.
    I truly think it's a wonderful way to journal.\" -Ashley Ann\n\n\"The
    new weekly review is amazing. The way your interests are categorized by
    color, each day is represented not by words but emotions, and you can
    clearly assess your week as an overview all from a small, simple, color
    coded view is brilliant. Well done!\" -Caroline Hagär\n\n\"Set up was
    really easy - and so far I am just blown away with the things I can track
    with this app. I have struggled to use my Bullet Journal and may have
    to find another use for the leather TN's I have purchased. This app so
    far is incredible.\" -Melanie Tash\n\n--------------\n\nPrincipally, daily
    diary entries can be viewed across a timeline we call your 'life calendar'
    containing all the weeks in your life. This is something that no other
    free notebook can provide, paper or digital... your life at a glance.\n\nFrom
    day one, viewing your position in life allows you to put things into context.
    Namely, how you've chosen to spend time so far, and your intentions for
    the future.\n\nYour daily journal entries made in the context of the bigger
    picture are more insightful, but are enhanced further by nifty ways to
    indicate your mood, your gratitude with time spent doing the things you
    love, and 'insights' about past events that make for great reading in
    retrospect.\n\nIt's very common to see folks keep a daily diary for a
    couple of weeks then stop. We recognize it can be hard when looking at
    the blank page of a journal notebook to come up with something insightful.
    But Perspective sets out to address the greatest barrier to successful,
    longterm journalling, that's why we added 'inspiration questions' for
    those times when we just can't think of anything to say, yet need to practice
    journaling to establish the habit.\n\nSpeaking of habits, we added 'Interests'
    for those wishing to track repetitive tasks, goals or habits.\n\nA simple
    clean interface, flexible enough to accommodate fast journaling, note
    taking, or bullet lists, and built with obsessive attention to detail."
